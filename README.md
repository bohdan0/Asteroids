# Space War

## Play [Space War](https://asteroids0.herokuapp.com "Space War")

Space War is example of Space Shooter games. It's single player game, where player drives space ship and shoots enemies. 

Player has 5 lives at beginning, It decreases each time player's ship is destroyed by enemy and when there are no lives game is over. 

I implemented 10 levels in this game with unique enemies. After 10th level enemies repeat. On each next level enemies have more health than previous, so It's harder to destroy all of them. 

There is score counter, It counts health of destroyed enemies. I used App Academy asteroids skeleton for this project.

I used canvas with transparent background plus cool background. For effects and bullets I used sprite sheets.
